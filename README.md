## History of Linux

Let‚Äôs go back to **1969**, when Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie of Bell Laboratories developed the **UNIX operating system**. It was later rewritten in C for greater portability and became widely used.

A decade later, Richard Stallman initiated the **GNU (GNU is Not UNIX) project**. While the GNU kernel, Hurd, unfortunately never came to completion, this effort led to the creation of the **GNU General Public License (GPL)**, a free software license.

The **kernel** is the most vital part of an operating system, enabling hardware to communicate with software. It controls almost everything on your system.

During this period, other UNIX-like systems like BSD and MINIX were developed, but they all lacked a unified kernel.

Then, in **1991**, Linus Torvalds began developing what we now know as the **Linux kernel**.

---

## 2. Choosing a Linux Distribution

The **Linux kernel** powers millions of devices daily. While "Linux" often refers to the kernel, many distributions use the Linux kernel and are commonly known as Linux operating systems.

A Linux system consists of three main parts:

- **Hardware**: Includes all physical components like memory, CPU, and disks.
- **Linux Kernel**: The core of the operating system, managing hardware interactions.
- **User Space**: Where users directly interact with the system.

The first step is installing Linux. This course will guide you in choosing a suitable distribution. We'll cover the most popular options.

---

## 3. Debian

**Overview**
Debian is an operating system entirely composed of **free and open-source software**. It has been in development for over 20 years and is widely recognized. You can choose from three branches: **Stable**, **Testing**, and **Unstable**.

Stable is generally recommended. Testing and Unstable are rolling releases, meaning incremental changes in these branches will eventually transition to Stable. For example, upgrading from Windows XP to Windows 10 requires a full installation, but on a Testing release, updates are automatically received until it becomes the next stable OS without needing a full reinstallation.

**Package Management**
Debian uses its own **Debian package management tools**. Different Linux distributions utilize various package managers, a topic we'll explore further in a later course.

**Configurability**
While Debian might not receive the absolute latest updates, it is **extremely stable**. If you desire a robust "core" operating system, Debian is an excellent choice.

**Uses**
Debian is a versatile operating system suitable for **any platform**.

---

## 4. Red Hat Enterprise Linux

**Overview**
**Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)**, developed by Red Hat, has strict rules restricting free re-distribution, though its source code is freely available.

**Package Management**
RHEL employs a different package manager than Debian: the **RPM package manager**, which we will also cover.

**Configurability**
RHEL-based operating systems differ slightly from Debian-based ones, primarily in package management. If you plan to work with RHEL, choosing it as your primary OS is advisable.

**Uses**
As its name suggests, RHEL is primarily used in **enterprise environments**, making it a strong choice for a reliable server OS.

---

## 5. Ubuntu

**Overview**
**Ubuntu** is one of the most popular Linux distributions for personal machines. It ships with its own desktop environment manager, Unity, by default.

**Package Management**
As a **Debian-based operating system** developed by Canonical, Ubuntu uses a core Debian package management system.

**Configurability**
Ubuntu is an excellent starting point for Linux beginners. Its ease of use and great user interface have contributed to its widespread adoption. It's widely used and supported, offering a usability experience similar to macOS and Windows.

**Uses**
Great for **any platform**: desktop, laptop, and server.

---

## 6. Fedora

**Overview**
Backed by Red Hat, the **Fedora Project** is a community-driven initiative featuring open-source and free software. Red Hat Enterprise Linux branches off Fedora, so consider Fedora an "upstream" RHEL operating system. RHEL eventually incorporates updates from Fedora after extensive testing and quality assurance. Think of Fedora as an Ubuntu equivalent, but with a Red Hat backend instead of Debian.

**Package Management**
Uses the **Red Hat package manager**.

**Configurability**
If you prefer a Red Hat-based operating system, Fedora offers a **user-friendly version**.

**Uses**
Fedora is ideal if you want a Red Hat-based operating system without the associated price tag. Recommended for **desktop and laptop use**.

---

## 7. Linux Mint

**Overview**
**Linux Mint** is based on Ubuntu and utilizes Ubuntu‚Äôs software repositories, making the same packages available on both distributions. If you're looking for a lighter distribution than Ubuntu, Linux Mint might be of interest.

**Package Management**
Since Linux Mint is Ubuntu-based, it uses the **Debian package manager**.

**Configurability**
Linux Mint offers a **great user interface**, is excellent for beginners, and is less bloated than Ubuntu. This course will use Linux Mint, but any other distribution can be used.

**Uses**
Great for **desktop and laptop use**.

---

## 8. Gentoo

**Overview**
**Gentoo** offers unparalleled flexibility with the operating system, but at a price. It's designed for advanced users who are comfortable with in-depth system configuration.

Gentoo uses its own package management system, **Portage**. Portage is highly modular and easy to maintain, which significantly contributes to the operating system's overall flexibility.

**Configurability**
If you're new to Linux and want to take a more challenging path, consider Gentoo or Arch Linux as your distribution.

**Uses**
Great for **desktop and laptop use**.

---

## 9. Arch Linux

**Overview**
**Arch Linux** is a lightweight and flexible distribution driven entirely by its community. Similar to Debian, Arch uses a **rolling release model**, where incremental updates eventually become the stable release. You'll need to delve deep into the system to understand its functions, but in return, you gain complete and total control.

**Package Management**
It uses its own package manager, **Pacman**, for installing, updating, and managing packages.

**Configurability**
If you want a lightweight operating system and genuinely want to understand Linux, use Arch! There's a learning curve, but for hardcore Linux users, it's an excellent choice.

**Uses**
Great for **desktop and laptop use**. It's also perfect for small devices like a Raspberry Pi when you need a lightweight OS.

# User and Privileges

In the **`ls -la`** output, "rwx" indicates file or directory permissions for three entities: **owner**, **group**, and **other users**. Each entity has three permission categories: **read (r)**, **write (w)**, and **execute (x)**.

* **Read (r)**: Allows viewing file contents or directory names.
* **Write (w)**: Enables modifying files or adding/deleting/renaming files within a directory.
* **Execute (x)**: Grants permission to run a file or enter a directory. For directories, execute permission is crucial for accessing their contents.

The `ls -la` output displays permissions as nine characters. The first character denotes the file type (`-` for a regular file, `d` for a directory). The next three characters are for the owner, followed by three for the group, and then three for other users.

**Example `ls -la` output line**:
`-rwxr-x--- 1 user group 4096 May 10 12:34 myfile.txt`

Here's the breakdown:

* **`-rwxr-x---`**:
    * First character (`-`): Regular file.
    * Next three (`rwx`): Owner has read, write, and execute permissions.
    * Next three (`r-x`): Group has read and execute permissions.
    * Last three (`---`): Other users have no permissions.
* **`1`**: Number of hard links to the file.
* **`user`**: File owner.
* **`group`**: Group assigned to the file.
* **`4096`**: File size in bytes.
* **`May 10 12:34`**: Date and time of last modification.
* **`myfile.txt`**: File name.

A hyphen (`-`) indicates that a permission is not granted. The output may also include special permissions, ownership, and timestamps.

Here are explanations and examples of the commands related to users and privileges:

* **`chmod`** (Change Mode):
    * *Explanation*: Changes a file or directory's permissions.
    * *Example*: `chmod +x script.sh` adds execute permission to "script.sh".

* **`adduser`**:
    * *Explanation*: Creates a new user account.
    * *Example*: `adduser john` creates "john" and prompts for details.

* **`su`** (Switch User):
    * *Explanation*: Allows switching to another user account.
    * *Example*: `su jane` switches to "jane" after password entry.

* **`/etc/sudoers`**:
    * *Explanation*: Displays the content of the `/etc/sudoers` file, which configures the `sudo` command.
    * *Example*: Running this command shows `sudo` access and permission directives.

* **`sudo -l`**:
    * *Explanation*: Lists commands a user is permitted to run with `sudo` privileges.
    * *Example*: `sudo -l` displays available commands and permissions for the current user with `sudo` access.
