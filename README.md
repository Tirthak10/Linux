## 📍 1. `pwd` — **Print Working Directory**

/home/tirthak/Documents

```
## 📂 2. `ls` — List Directory Contents

Tip:

ls -l → Long listing format with permissions

ls -a → Includes hidden files

ls -lh → Human-readable sizes



## 📁 3. `cd foldername` — Change Directory

**Description:**  
Moves you into a specified directory. Remember: **Linux is case-sensitive**.

Note:
If the folder name is Downloads, cd downloads will not work.

Would you like me to continue with this exact formatting for the rest of the commands (6–12)? I can compile all of them into one full `.md` file and share it with you as a download too.
